**Music Arena** is a free platform for evaluating and comparing AI music generation models. Type a text prompt for any music you can imagine and press "{GENERATE_BUTTON_LABEL}"! Music Arena will even generate lyrics for you if your prompt implies that you want them.

Music Arena is primarily operated by the [Generative Creativity Lab (G-CLef)](https://chrisdonahue.com/#group) at Carnegie Mellon University, with support from [Sony AI](https://ai.sony) and assistance from [LMArena](https://lmarena.ai). See {TAB_ABOUT} for more details.

**How to participate**:

1. ‚úçÔ∏è Enter a prompt and click "{GENERATE_BUTTON_LABEL}" to generate two different songs.
1. üéß Listen to both songs.
1. üó≥Ô∏è Vote on which you prefer.
1. üíæ After voting, you may download the generated music that you voted for.
1. üìä Your votes will be used to compile a _leaderboard_ of the best models.

**Known issues**:

1. Limited number of models available supporting vocal generation.
1. Slow (~60s) generation times for open weights models.

**Feedback**:

Aside from the known issues above, please direct any feedback to chrisdonahue@cmu.edu. Alternatively, you can [submit a bug report](https://forms.gle/DxUii6ys7Rj7jbR7A).

**Models**. Two of the following models are randomly selected for each round:
