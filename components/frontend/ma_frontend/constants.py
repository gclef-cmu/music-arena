**Music Arena** is a free platform for evaluating and comparing AI music generation models. Type a text prompt for any music you can imagine and press "{GENERATE_BUTTON_LABEL}"! Music Arena will even generate lyrics for you if your prompt implies that you want them.

Music Arena is an _academic research project_ operated by the [Generative Creativity Lab (G-CLef)](https://chrisdonahue.com/#group) at Carnegie Mellon University. Our primary goals are to provide rigorous evaluation for music generation models, and to provide an open and renewable source of music generation preference data for the research community. See our [paper]({PAPER_URL}) for more details.

**How to participate**:

1. ‚úçÔ∏è Enter a prompt and click "{GENERATE_BUTTON_LABEL}" to generate two different songs.
1. üéß Listen to both songs.
1. üó≥Ô∏è Vote on which you prefer.
1. üíæ After voting, you may download the generated music that you voted for.
1. üìä Your votes will be used to compile a _leaderboard_ of the best models.

**Known issues**:

1. Limited number of models available supporting vocal and lyrics generation.
1. Some models will generate vocals even for instrumental prompts.
1. Slow (~60s) generation times for open weights models.

**Feedback**:

Please submit any feedback using [this form]({FEEDBACK_FORM_URL}).

**Models**. Two of the following models are randomly selected for each round:
